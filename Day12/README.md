# Basic-ToDo-WebApp

This project was built while I was learning to do basic DOM manipulation in
Javascript.If you find any bug or issue, please open an issue, will solve it. You can fork the project if you want.

A request is that, don't judge me based on the code in this repo. I am really new to
the JavaScript world (kinda liking it actually).

See the App live at the below Codepen Link.
